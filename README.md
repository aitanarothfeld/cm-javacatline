## My javascript project

In this file is a simple javascript website, using p5.js libary examples in order to run a few functions. The main features are an image based animation that repeats going across the x-axis, a background falling snow animation, and a sound file that repeats.

### Serving the website locally

You can run this by running `live-server`.live
